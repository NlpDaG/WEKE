construct robust rule set for classif we studi the problem of comput classif rule set from relat databas so that accur predict can be made on test data with miss attribut valu tradit classifi perform bad when test data are not as complet as the train data becaus they tailor a train databas too much we introduc the concept of one rule set be more robust than anoth that is abl to make more accur predict on test data with miss attribut valu we show that the optim class associ rule set is as robust as the complet class associ rule set we then introduc the k-optim rule set which provid predict exact the same as the optim class associ rule set on test data with up to k miss attribut valu this lead to a hierarchi of k-optim rule set in which decreas size correspond to decreas robust and they all more robust than a tradit classif rule set we introduc two method to find k-optim rule set i.e. an optim associ rule mine approach and a heurist approxim approach we show experiment that a k-optim rule set generat by the optim associ rule mine approach perform better than that by the heurist approxim approach and both rule set perform signific better than a typic classif rule set c4 .5 rule on incomplet test data
